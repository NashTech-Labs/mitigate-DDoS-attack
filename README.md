- A DDoS attack is done by an attacker in order to slow down the service by increasing a huge amount of traffic congestion to a specific target application or website and this makes it very difficult for normal users to use the application.
- Genuine users or application owners will see the effect of a DDoS attack as a drastic reduction of speed or complete outage or any other unknown consequences that they are habitual to see in normal operations.
